                Brings attention to the shockingly barren field that an ethical framework of behavior for autonomous machines should be taking fruition in. Highlights some of the problems with developing a ‘hard-coded’ moral bible based on an ambiguous and fluid system as well as a proposal, if only philosophically, for how to lay the groundwork a unified ethics protocol for autonomous machines. High quality work with smooth transitions between tech-speak and laymen’s terms; presents a compelling perspective. Useful for understanding how human ethics is a system of feedback loops that spur both evaluation and action as well as how this relates to ethical operations of machines in increasingly ambiguous and complex roles.

                Proposes a theoretical framework for ethical protocols that can be formally verified leading to a code based certification of being ‘morally sound’ for autonomous systems allowing them to operate with a greater degree of safety around humans. Very high quality work and equally as technical requiring a knowledge base in computer science and mathematics to understand core concepts and proofs. Useful for understanding how logic based programming and methods can be used to achieve a system of actionable ethical directives without extensively and futilely attempting to address every possible ethical dilemma an autonomous machine could encounter during its operations.

                A statistical analysis and mathematical modeling of decision making processes based on relative positions in declared and undeclared sociological networks with a proposition of possible experimental tests to further research the correlations found within the initial data. Interestingly disturbing in scope, the implications that underlie the potential applications of the research leave one with a slightly haunting big brother feeling after having recollected themselves from their brain melting inside their skull due to reading twenty extremely technical and at times confusing pages of statistical data analysis. Useful as a launching pad into further research centered around minimizing conflict and dissent among members of certain social networks when presented with typically controversial objects (issues, topics, information, etc).

                A general overview of the current state of the artificial intelligence as a crash course into navigating the ever expanding quagmire the field is quickly becoming due to lack of cohesion between researchers, media, and the markets over abuse of buzzwords. Provides good contextual background on some core issues before delving into Kurzweil’s book “The Singularity is near” with McDermott’s critique in an engaging and well written style that keeps tech speak to a minimum. Useful for an alternative view on Kurzweil’s theories as well as a host of other not only possible but plausible manifestations the emergence of artificial intelligence could take.

                Covers some major issues surrounding the use of artificial intelligence in health care services as well as some related major scientific breakthroughs and their potential applications bringing to bear the need for clear and concise guidelines if these advancements are to be utilized. Interesting to read with low levels of tech speak making it easy to understand the core issues presented. Useful for understanding how new technological and scientific developments often have extreme difficulty in being integrated into the health care system’s ridged and often unforgiving legal framework.

                Provides a new perspective on the Turing test as well as issues regarding the tendency to fall victim to the human impulse to anthropomorphize especially in the field of artificial intelligence. Well-structured arguments and good content make up for being written in a somewhat dry and dense style. Useful for understanding the complexities in definitive ‘eureka!’ moments while determining when exactly an entity is considered artificially intelligent and the implications that such labels carry with them.

                A discussion the philosophy and etiology regarding the art of argumentation in relation to artificial intelligence and its application in developing logic structures in AI entities. Extremely interesting, although a bit dry at parts, easy to understand and move through despite its length. Useful background knowledge in understanding how the shape and form of arguments has evolved over time and how the perspective shifts when trying to recreate the process by division of its parts in a programmable way.
