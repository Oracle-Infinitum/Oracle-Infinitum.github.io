            Artificial Intelligence: an extremely complex term and field of scientific endeavor with multiple different meanings and implications. Most of which however fall under the umbrella of a reference to a sentient human-made construct that is possessive of both awareness of Self and the ability to make empathetic connections with others. The implied state of this entity involves a “host body” of computers and access to the resources that entails. Just as a human being is not necessarily defined by its body alone and has access and the means to control and apply that body.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Putting this into perspective, with limited knowledge and understanding, a relatively short life span, and limited resources, it has been the capabilities of the human mind and body that have allowed our species to cross the world, given birth to every city ever built, eradicate disease, explore the depths of the oceans, and have allowed us to take flight and soar among the stars. Now imagine an artificially intelligent entity with resources of a super computer, capable of performing calculations and solving problems in seconds what would take humans years to accomplish. Now, with near limitless memory and perfect recall, imagine what it could accomplish with access to the largest repository of information ever compiled in the history of the human race, the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Herein lies the core of the modern debate regarding the issue. Human beings are capable of both miraculous and terrible things. Just as our ability to manifest wondrous things is limited by our means and resources, so too is our capacity for destruction. Advances in science and technology have removed many of those barriers. Many once fatal injuries and diseases are now routine and extremely low risk events. Knowledge once obtainable by only the very lucky or very wealthy is widely available and for free. Where the body count attributable to a single person was once measured by their physical prowess and martial skill, can now total out an entire city from something as simple as a 3D printer and a genetically engineered virus.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where a fear of a Terminator type event comes from. If a single human being is capable of wiping out thousands of people at once, and in some cases the entire species, what could an AI entity accomplish with greater resources and a significantly higher learning curve? You might be thinking now that this all paints a really nice picture of risk vs reward or good vs evil and for whichever side you happen to be on, relatively straight forward.
        </p>
        <br/>
        You would be so very wrong.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Do you remember when I said this issue was complex? Let’s rewind back to the part where the AI wasn’t trying to kill us. Let us say we limit its capabilities to influence or access events outside the lab where it was created. There isn’t a single scientific, economic, environmental, or medical field that couldn’t benefit from an AI entity. Capable of performing independent analysis and creating new and novel experiments based on unique interpretations and patterns on a level that we could only dream of, all of its own volition. The problem with this is that we would be creating a self-aware and sentient being with the explicit intent of never letting it see the light of day and exploiting it for its labor for the duration of its lifespan.

            This gives rise to a very important question. If a machine is indistinguishable from that of a human being in every way, should it possess the same rights as a human? Although this one might keep you up at night, its well worth it to take the time and think deeply on it. Over the past century nearly every country around the world has collectively agreed that:
        </p>
        <div id="UN_Quote">
            <p>
                “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.” 
                <div class="Source_Cite">
                    (United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, Article II).
                </div>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Following this, let us say for a moment that we did hold an AI entity on equal grounds and deserving of every fundamental right that a human being holds. If this AI, which can simultaneously exist on servers in China, Sweden, Russia, and the US, commits what is considered a crime in the UK, which country is it to be prosecuted by? It neither has a nationality or a means by which is imprisonment with the purpose of rehabilitation can be defined. Wait wait wait, I’m confused. I thought we were advocating for giving it human rights?
        </p>
        <p>
            So with hopes that you haven’t yet thrown your hands up and stormed away from the monitor, it boils down to this. Creating a sentient being with the sole purpose of depriving of its any rights or hope of freedom and subjugating it to our desires is the darkest form of violence and arguably the very definition of slavery. Yet to assign a being, whose capabilities in a number of areas far exceed that of a human, equal rights and representation, is a move open to folly on the level of an extinction wide event. So it seems the only solution to the problem is to prevent it from taking place in the first place. A worldwide ban on the creation of AI. I disagree.
        </p>
        Shocking I know.
