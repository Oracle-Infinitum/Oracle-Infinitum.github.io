            The controversy of whether or not machines are or could ever be capable of moral agency is a relatively new topic compared with the long standing and ancient field of ethics, having only emerged within the last century with the invention of the digital computer, but brings with it a massive and complicated philosophical as well as technical minefield that we still have yet to successfully navigate <citation>. The issue was brought to light when Alan Turing, widely considered the father of computer science, proposed a similar question in his paper ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’<citation>:  Can machines think? A profound question especially considering it was asked in a time when digital computers had barely invented and one that would prove not easily answered
        </p>
        <p> 
            It’s difficult to define what exactly ‘thinking’ is in unambiguous terms. Is it the ability to problem solve? A system of ropes, pulleys, and buckets of water can be constructed to solve problems and it wouldn’t even have a pulse. Is it the ability to assess and react to external information? Plants through a process of photosynthesis <citation> can change their structure and relative position to better absorb sunlight yet we hardly regard plants as deep thinkers. The deeper we go the less obvious it becomes what we often take for granted in being able to determine what thinking is. So the question moves away from necessarily defining what real thinking is to asking does it really matter?
</p>
        <p>
            This might strike you as amusing or a nihilistic abandonment of the whole subject but take a moment to consider it. Can you prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that a given person is actually thinking and possess free will; that we aren’t just complex plant like beings who react to stimuli in patterns that best serve our interests? Can you prove that you yourself, are really alive and not just a bio-form machine? So we come back again the question of does it really matter, as fulfilling as our lives are, if we really have free will or if we’ve all been fooled into just thinking we do? Would it make any difference? 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where we diverge from trying to prove whether or not a machine could ever be capable of possessing genuine intelligence or morality, to asking what we’re going to do when we can’t tell the difference between what’s real and what’s not. Or to put it more elegantly, if a machine was indistinguishable from that of a human being in every way, does it deserve the same rights as a human being? With this question as our contextual anchor we can dive into the heart of it and explore what progress has been made in addressing what most experts in artificial intelligence consider an inevitability more than a what if <citation>.
</p>
        <p>
            So in a day and age when drone are delivering our amazon orders <citation>, google computers are making trippy expensive art <citation>, and a supercomputer named Watson just beat the world’s best players in the board game Go <citation>, you would think there would be a substantial amount of headway being made in the legal realms. What you’ll actually find is nothing, a yawning black abyss so lacking in anything it feels as if it is reaching out to crush your sense of rationality under the weight of its immense void. Poetic descriptions aside, there has been little or no work done regarding the legal or ethical protocol surrounding the emergence of an artificially intelligent entity.
