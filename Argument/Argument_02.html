            Artificial intelligence, a phrase that gets tossed around in today’s world as buzzword. Used as an umbrella term that covers everything from smart phone apps to data analysis of financial holdings, even the chatty computer programs that talk to you. While many of these are undoubtedly complex, they are pale imitations of what is at the heart of what is quickly becoming one of the most important scientific fields of study. The core of Artificial Intelligence as a field of inquiry, can be summed up by a question posed by Alan Turing, whom is widely considered the father of computer science, in his paper ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’.
        </p>
        <p class="centered">
            Can machines think?
        </p>
        <p>
            At first glance the question seems almost infantile, too simple to warrant an entire scientific discipline. We find however, that in our attempt to answer it, that it is an immensely difficult and complex question. A question very much worth asking.
        </p>
        <p>
            How exactly do we define what it is to be able to think? A system of ropes, pulleys, and buckets of water can be constructed to solve problems and it wouldn’t even have a pulse. Is it the ability to react perceive and react to external stimuli? Plants can rearrange which direction they face to maximize exposure to sunlight and yet, outside of a Douglas Adams novel, we don’t quite feel right ascribing the title of ‘deep thinker’ to your petunias. The harder we try to define exactly what thinking is, the more elusive that definition seems to become, lost within a sea of ambiguities.
        </p>

            In fact Louise Dennis, in her paper Formal Verification of Ethical Choices in Autonomous Systems (2016), proposes a theoretical framework that through the use of logic based programming and methods can be used to achieve a robust system of actionable and ethical directives without extensively and futilely attempting to address every possible ethical dilemma an autonomous machine could encounter during its operation. This means that not only could a machine be programmed to deal with complex tasks like surgical intervention during a medical emergency but also be fluid within its ability to make decisions based on the circumstances it finds itself. More importantly it means that a machine can make decisions stemming from an adaptive moral foundation instead of simply being hard coded to carry out its programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now normally we consider morality a trait strictly reserved for human beings but now we have to ask ourselves what exactly is morality why is it important? To answer the first part of our question, according to the Oxford Dictionary, morality is defined as “A particular system of values and principles of conduct, especially one held by a specified person or society” (Oxford University Press, 2016). So our repulsion to heinous acts of crime such as murder or our sense of elation as justice finds a way to prevail, is really just us adhering to a set of instructions and conditions over the course of our lifetimes. Which one could argue is no different than the proposed system mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason why this is so important is that human beings have invested a great deal into creating a world based on such systems. At times and in many places around the world these systems differ sometimes drastically from our own. Generally they all work along the lines of assigning values of good and bad to conditions and things but its more than that. Morality gives rise to our ethical principles which is the glue to bonds us together, often uniting fundamentally different and radically opposing groups which might otherwise be in a perpetual state of war and conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of how our moral definitions and the ethical principles that follow shape our world is the judicial system. Our entire legal system is one that is constantly being constructed and reconstructed based on the evolution of our society, how we interact with each other, and the principles it holds. The idea that machines could be capable of moral agency and adaptive interpretation of its environment gives rise to the notion that it would certainly be possible for autonomous machines, if not AI, to not only operate within our society but do so in a manner very similar to the people already living in it (Waser, 2015).
