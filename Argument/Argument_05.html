            We do still have time on our side however. At present date the field of artificial intelligence has had a long history of promising breakthroughs hinting at an emergent event just around the corner only to be dashed and lull back into hibernation. But make no mistake, there is urgency to warrant our immediate involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Research into artificial intelligence is being conducted from both ends and some of the more exciting developments have been made from a top down approach (Goertzel 2007). In attempts to map out and understand how the brain translates thought into action experiments have been done in allowing human beings to control robotic devices with their thoughts as was mentioned before. What was not mentioned however was those trials gave rise to other experiments allowing human beings to interface and control computers, the use of fully digital bionics limbs, even allow blind persons to see through digital camera implants.

            These kinds of developments which hold a lot of promise especially in the medical field, already begin to blur the lines we’ve defined ourselves within. The same complications that arose out of an AI being are very similar to ones that present themselves when a human being is augmented with technology that allows them to surpass their otherwise normal limitations. So whether it’s a machine learning how to interact and navigate the human world or a human learning how to exist in a digital one, progress marches on. Where this road leads is in no way certain but we certainly cannot afford not to take a hand in determining its course.

            An event as game changing as the introduction of artificial intelligence demands careful consideration of all the variables. Even with meticulous planning and projection, the possibility of disaster still looms like a storm just on the horizon. It is here that we lay bare the beating heart of the issue. The creation of life is a realm of power and responsibility that has been reserved for the gods of our past and it is one that were are foolishly about to ascend to because it is no longer a question of if creating such life would be possible, only a matter of when. We’ve been so caught up in whether or not we could, that we have failed to even ask ourselves why it is we should and more importantly, what happens when we do.
