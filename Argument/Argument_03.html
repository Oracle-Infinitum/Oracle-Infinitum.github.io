            Our initial question now begins to drift away from necessarily defining what ‘real thinking' is, to a more pointed question of asking does it really matter? This might strike you as amusing or a cheap abandonment of the whole subject but take a moment to consider it. Can you prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that a given person is actually thinking and possess free will; that we aren’t just complex plant-like beings who react to stimuli in patterns that best serve our interests? Can you prove that you yourself, are really alive and not just an organic machine?
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, the ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence, the holy grail of its scientific endeavors, would be the creation of a self-aware entity that is capable of independent thought and self-determination. This means creating an entirely new form of life that has never existed before. A new species that in many ways is a mirror of the human race and yet fundamentally different from it. The implications of such a being emerging into our world are staggering and would without a doubt would change the course of human history in unimaginable ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            So is any of this even possible outside science fiction? The answer is that we’re much closer than you might think. A quick web search for ‘mind controlled robot’ will pull up dozens of different research projects that have successfully developed devices that allow a human being to control an external robotic device through neural synaptic signals, which are the same signals that allow us to control our limbs and bodies. Another quick search for ‘Boston Dynamics robots’ will pull up numerous examples of human and animal like robots capable of navigating and interacting with our human world.
        </p>
        <p>
            We discussed earlier that the deeper one tries to dissect and define what it is that makes us human the harder it becomes to prove, and as a whole still haven’t come up with a suitable answer. So we come back again to the question of does it really matter? Let us imagine for a moment, that science has advanced to the point where we can fully grow a human being, from replicating a sperm and egg with all their genetic complexities and incubating it all the way to the same point as a new born baby (Spector 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
            As this child grows up, they will be able to learn how to speak, how to read, how to play basketball (Kurgurakova, 2015). They will be capable of having hopes and dreams the same as anyone else born from the womb and like everyone else will eventually die. With this lab born child sitting next to a womb born child, how do we decide what qualifies one as a human being with protected rights and the other as a piece of property to be owned and destroyed?
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, although we may not have an exact answer to our question, we find that it matters less and less of how somebody came to be cast into this world, and find that what matters more is how they and we interact with each other. So if an entity we created in a lab interacts with human society the same as another human born into it does it deserve rights? Another way of putting it might be to ask if an artificially intelligent entity was indistinguishable from that of a human being, in every way, does it deserve the same rights as a human being? I would argue that no, it doesn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you haven’t thrown up your hands in exasperation and stormed away from the monitor, I apologize for any frustration I might have just incurred. With that said, you might be wondering why, after going through such lengths to argue that if an artificially intelligent entity looked like a human, walked like a human, and spoke like a human, that at the end of it all it doesn’t deserve the same rights as a human. To expand on my previous answer, while I don’t believe that it should have the same rights as a human I do believe that it should have rights tailored specifically around the conditions of their existence.
