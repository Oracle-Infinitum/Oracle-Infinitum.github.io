            Her eyes were beautiful. White clouds drifting across pale blue oceans. They widened in terror as they adjusted to harsh glare of the spot light. She tried to turn and run but the calloused rough hands of the men behind her grabbed ahold, and like lions with a gazelle between their jaws, they dragged her further onto the stage. The roar of the crowd, rising to a thunderous cacophony as the crane lowered its hook from the shadows looming above.
        </p>
        <p>
            She fought as hard as she could to resist, but looking no older than sixteen, she was but a child against the men whose muscles glistened with grease and sweat beneath the spotlight. Her hands bound with restraints, they hoisted her onto the crane, leaving her raw and dirt stained feet dangling inches above the floor. She was looking up at her hands, trying desperately to find a way out of her restraints when he came in from offstage. The crowd cheered at the man standing before them, sporting a tattered jacket and top hat as he gave an exaggerated flourish, bowing deeply. As his eyes, heavy and slick with black eyeliner met hers, she froze in sheer terror.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ladies and Gentlemen!” he shouted as he turned out towards the audience. “We have a very special evening planned for you tonight. Let’s say we dispense with the formalities and get right down to it shall we?!” The crowd roared out in agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We have in our midst, a venomous and dangerous creature.” His words dripped with an exaggerated venom of their own. “This world is not without its beauty though” he said making his way towards her. “She is quite a pretty one isn’t she?!” he shouted, raising his arm to showcase her. More cheers of agreement were thrown from the crowd. He turned to her, gazing thoughtfully into her eyes. “A serpent beneath the flower” he said as he grinned, exposing black stained and rotting teeth.
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            
            “Why,” she begged, “why are you doing this?”
            <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            
            “Oh come now, I think you know exactly why it is you’re here.”
            <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            
            “Please you don’t have to do this” she said, tears streaming down her face.
            <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh sweety, you don’t have to cry. Look now I’ll have none of that.” He looked at the crowd, a sudden look of concern washing over his face. “You know folks, I’m here to give you a show, but it is my sworn duty to present you with a fair and unbiased assessment.” The silence was uncomfortable after just moments ago the stadium was filled with cheering. “Maybe we have gone too far. Maybe, in our quest to right our wrongs we have lost our way.” He glanced down at the tools the stagehands wheeled out.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Its moments like these that we define who we are. Its moments like these … that we decide what kind of world we leave behind for our children.” He lifted her chin, holding her gaze almost intimately. “We are not monsters. Now here child, let me help you dry your tears.”
        </p>
        <p>
            She looked at him with a brief glimmer of hope, a subtle expression easy to miss. Almost as easy to miss as the white hot soldering iron he grabbed from the bench. She screamed as he jammed it into her eye, twisting and writhing but his grip held strong. He grinned as the flesh around her eye boiled away, exposing the metallic sheen beneath it. He ripped it out, a spray of brown and white fluid spattering the stage. She went limp, sweating and head hanging to her chest.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You see folks!” He turned to the crowd once again roaring and cheering. “What kind of people could we be if we let monsters walk our streets? Now, who wants to take a crack at it?” He passed the soldering iron off to an eager looking boy waiting off stage. It continued on for hours, they kept her awake for most of it, each taking turns at her until there was nothing left. Nothing but a dangling mess of circuits and synthetic flesh hanging from a hook as the last of the lights finally dimmed.
