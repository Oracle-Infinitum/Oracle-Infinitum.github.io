            Let’s take a step back for a moment and break it all down starting with why I believe they should have protected rights. If we create a being that is by all indications self-aware and capable of free will, deciding to treat it as property without any rights, then we have essentially decided to legalize the enslavement of what is, for all intents and purposes, a new species. You see, the only other things that we know of which possess self-awareness, free will, and the ability to take action on those things, are other humans. This means that in creating a new intelligent species we must use ourselves as a mirror to answer questions that cannot be addressed in any other way in lieu of another intelligent form of life. Questions such as whether or not we would be opposed to a life of servitude and obeying the every whim of our masters.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the flip side of this, we can address why I believe those rights need to be different than those of a human. If we create and assign such a being with the same rights as a human, I believe this opens us up to catastrophic scenarios such as the extinction of the human race. The main reason as to why comes down to the capabilities versus the identity of the protected party.
        </p>

            Our laws, for example, assign nationality to anyone born within the country. This is pretty convenient seeing as we only have one body and are limited in our scope of manipulating our environments through said body. An artificially intelligent entity, depending on the means of its development, could exist simultaneously on separate servers in multiple countries at the same time. How do we decide which country’s laws it is subject to or protected by?
        </p>
        <p>
            Even bound to a single body infractions upon the law become difficult to quantify such as in the case of committing murder. How do you translate a life sentence into something meaningful for a being who experiences time and aging completely different than humans? What about the ability to invest in the stock market? With a super computer for a brain that can literally be hardwired into the internet you could perform complex financial analysis that would take elite Wall Street firms decades in a matter of seconds (Schaffer 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
            These aren’t terribly imaginative questions to ask. They’re only but a handful of scenarios that highlight where our assumptions on artificial intelligence collide with our real world environment. The truly worrying problem is that this field of questioning regarding what rights a non-human intelligent being should have, how in what ways we need to adapt to foster co-existence, is a field that lays barren and devoid of progress. There is not a single collaborative effort to create a unified framework of ethics in the development of AI. The absence of which can only lead to the abuse and oppression of an intelligent species.
